# surfProject
A project to find the winner of a surf heat in JavaScript


Problem Statment:

Nowadays, in Brazil, doesn't exist a system to provide scores management of a surf championship, everything is done manually, on paper.


Proposed Solution:

Provide a system to help the judges insert scores, fast and easy, at a surf championship, automatically calculating the heat's scores, live, upgrading the process to find the heat's champion. Helping local's championships improve their score system.
